MORE DETAILS AND DEFINITION ON EVERY FACTS TABLE:
1. Fact Table: LMIA Approvals
This fact table represents the approvals of LMIA applications.
It’s primarily concerned with how many applications were approved in various categories.
Measures: The total number of approved LMIA applications, possibly broken down by:
Year
Province
NOC Skill Level
NOC Skill Type
Stream
This table helps answer questions like:

"How many LMIAs were approved for skilled workers in Ontario in 2022?"
"How many LMIA approvals were in the agriculture sector in 2020?"
2. Fact Table: LMIA Positions
This fact table focuses on the number of positions requested by employers in the LMIA process.
The measure here is the number of positions requested for foreign workers, as listed in the LMIA application.
This can be broken down by:
Industry (NAICS code)
Province
Occupation (NOC)
Skill Level (NOC)
Example questions this table helps answer:

"How many positions were requested in the health care sector in British Columbia?"
"What occupations had the highest number of positions requested in 2021?"
It is not about the number of approvals but rather the demand for positions.

3. Fact Table: Unique Employers
This fact table tracks employers who have submitted LMIA applications.
The measure here is the number of unique employers applying for LMIAs.
This can be broken down by:
Province
Economic Region
Stream
Industry (NAICS code)
Example questions:

"How many unique employers submitted LMIA applications in 2023 in Ontario?"
"Which industry had the most unique employers submitting LMIAs?"
Why These Are Separate Fact Tables:
Approvals focus on the outcome of the LMIA process (whether applications were approved or not).
Positions focus on the demand from employers—how many positions they requested foreign workers for.
Unique Employers focus on the source of the LMIA applications—i.e., the employers themselves.
In Practice:
These fact tables might be related, but they represent different aspects of the LMIA process. By separating them into distinct fact tables, you allow for more granular analysis.
Example of How They Work Together:
Let's say you want to know how the number of approved LMIAs compares to the number of requested positions by unique employers in a specific province.

You could:

Join the Fact_LMIA_Approvals table with the Fact_LMIA_Positions table on the province and year.
Compare how many positions were requested vs how many were approved.
Then, you could link to the Unique Employers table to see how many employers applied for the positions in that province.
